## Overview

Not all privacy browsers are built the same; as such they don't deliver the exact same results. This tool aims to fix that by painting an as-complete-as-possible picture of the different privacy browsers out there _before_ users commit to a download/install.

This privacy browser comparison tool aims to be easily readable and usable for **all** users, regardless of personal technical expertise.

The interactive and fancily rendered version of this table/tool is hosted @ https://avoidthehack.com/util/browser-comparison; we also perform periodic reviews of browsers (https://avoidthehack.com/tools/privacy-browsers)

## FAQ
### Where is Chrome, Edge, Safari?
Traditionally, these browsers aren't classified as "private" browsers. While they can be hardened to _some_ degree, it's generally recommended to migrate from these browsers when possible to do so. 

This is because the hardening process with these browsers can be tedious, requiring many different tweaks in different locations. Some settings may not be "Accessible" unless one is willing to edit code or go to more extreme measures. There is also the issue of silent automatic updates rolling back your changes to the new version's default.

If you're not familiar with the perils of using browsers like Microsoft and Google Chrome, then please get familiar with how these browsers are terrible for privacy @ the [avoidthehack Privacy Browsers page](https://avoidthehack.com/tools/privacy-browsers)

### Where is TOR?
Since TOR is configured to run on the onion (Tor) network, this makes it a completely different animal from just about every browser found here. This isn't necessarily an overly "good" or "bad" thing - just that TOR is _different enough_ to not be included here.

TOR has many unique characteristics about and surrounding it, especially the technology behind the `.onion` network and its relay hops. TOR can be used to browse the clearnet, deepweb, and the "darknet."

TOR is generally recommended as the de facto standard for users looking to be **anonymous** while browsing. The browsers listed here may provide some privacy or security benefits, but generally do not provide anonymity.
