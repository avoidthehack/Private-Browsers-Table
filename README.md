## Overview

Not all privacy browsers are built the same; as such they don't deliver the exact same results. This tool aims to fix that by painting an as-complete-as-possible picture of the different privacy browsers out there _before_ users commit to a download/install.

This privacy browser comparison tool aims to be easily readable and usable for **all** users, regardless of personal technical expertise.

The interactive and fancily rendered version of this table/tool is hosted @ https://avoidthehack.com/util/browser-comparison; we also perform periodic reviews of browsers (https://avoidthehack.com/tools/privacy-browsers)
