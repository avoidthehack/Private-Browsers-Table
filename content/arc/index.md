# More information: Arc Browser

The Arc Browser integrates web browsing and applications/features to be an "operating system for the web." **The browser requires an account to use.**

Arc ships with its own in-built apps and has official integrations for third parties, such as Notion and WhatsApp. It uses vertical tabs by default and allows users to customize their experience (via CSS, HTML, and JavaScript) using its "Boosts" feature.

Arc is built using Swift but maintains a Chromium code base.
