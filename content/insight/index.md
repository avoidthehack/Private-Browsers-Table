# More information: Insight Browser

Insight Browser is a closed source browser maintained by Laso Technologies. It claims to be the first iOS with support for extensions. It has a native ad blocking solution, though it appears to collect search history and usage data, (according to its own App Privacy disclosure in the Apple App Store.)

Insight Browser is only available on iOS.
