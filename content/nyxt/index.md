# More information: Nyxt

Nyxt is an open source browser developed and primarily maintained by developers at Atlas. Nyxt uses an API to interact/use any web engine (the project describes itself as "web engine agnostic"); it supports WebKit and WebEngine and, experimentally, Blink.  

It has a native adblocker and has many keyboard shortcuts. Nyxt does not support WebRTC. Nyxt is extensible and only supports extensions developed in Lisp.

Nyxt is only available for Linux systems.

**Note:** The developers have indicated Windows and macOS versions are in development.
