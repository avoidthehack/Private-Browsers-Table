# More information: Firefox Focus

**Not the same as Firefox Mobile or Fennec.**

Firefox Focus is a variant of Firefox (Mobile) maintained by Mozilla. It started off as a tracker blocker for iOS devices in 2015 before evolving into a standalone browser circa 2016.

Firefox Focus is a minimalist browser, lacking common browser features such as tabs and tab management. It also functions exclusively in a "private browsing" mode where history and cookies are deleted when the browser is closed. It has a lightweight footprint.

Firefox Focus is only available for mobile devices on iOS or Android. On iOS, Firefox Focus can integrate its blocking capabilities with Safari.
