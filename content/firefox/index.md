# More information: Firefox
 Firefox originally forked from the defunct "Mozilla browser" in **2004**. Firefox also includes in-browser translations and a feature to auto-close cookie banners as of version. Firefox has a vast library of browser plugins, called "Add-ons," and the developer, Mozilla, maintains a website for add-on download.

 Firefox serves as the upstream for most Gecko-based browsers, including privacy-hardened forks such as Librewolf and speed-oriented forks like Waterfox. Older Gecko codebase has also spawned hard-forks that no longer explicitly rely on Firefox as an upstream provider such as Pale Moon.

## avoidthehack weigh-ins
        
avoidthehack Recommendation status: **Recommended** ([Linux/macOS](https://avoidthehack.com/best-linux-macos-privacy-browsers) | [Windows](https://avoidthehack.com/best-privacy-browsers-windows-10))

Default Firefox still leaves a lot on the table when it comes to privacy. To reach its "true" privacy potential, Firefox must be "hardened" or tweaked: <a class="button" href="https://avoidthehack.com/firefox-privacy-config"> Harden Firefox</a>

**Note:** Mozilla tracks downloads of Firefox with a unique ID.</div>
