# More information: Brave

The Brave browser is an extensive fork of Chromium that either proxies or removes certain Google services and server callbacks from the source code. It was first launched in 2016 by a former employee of Mozilla.

Brave browser has a "Tor" tabs feature, while it does use the Tor network as a proxy, it does not provide the same level of privacy and anonymity inherent to using the Tor browser. Brave also has "forgetful browsing," and an opt-in, built-in cryptocurrency wallet using the Basic Attention Token (BAT) ecosystem.

As of February 2024, Brave has started rolling out its AI assistant, "Leo," to the Brave browser on certain platforms.
