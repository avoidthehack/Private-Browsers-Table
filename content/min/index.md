# More information: Min

Min is an open-source web browser built entirely on Electron, written entirely in CSS and JavaScript. 

While Min uses the Chromium rendering engine, it is not considered a Chromium fork. This is because it does not use the same browser interface (that is also integrated with Google services) used by Chromium and other true Chromium forks such as Ungoogled Chromium and Brave.

Min markets itself as a faster, minimal web browser that allows users to "browse without distractions." Min includes a native adblocker by default.
