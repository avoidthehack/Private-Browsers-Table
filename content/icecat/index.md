# More information: Icecat

Icecat (GNU Icecat) is the GNU version of the Firefox browser, made up of only free software and a less restrictive license. Icecat includes privacy protections such as LibreJS, JShelter, and fingerprinting countermeasures.

Icecat is _officially_ only available for GNU/Linux systems. The project does not distribute binaries.

**Note:** An unofficial website hosting Windows and macOS version exists but is not officially endorsed by GNU.
