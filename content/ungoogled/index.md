# More information: Ungoogled Chromium

Ungoogled Chromium is a community-driven and maintained fork of vanilla Google Chromium with a goal of _removing_ Google-related services, telemetry, and other Google-connected dependencies in the source code. While this improves privacy, users should expect a level of breakage with this browser.

Ungoogled Chromium introduces features, such as setting the default search provider to "No search." It also borrows features from other Chromium browser projects, such as Bromite and the Iridium Browser.

If users choose to install Ungoogled Chromium using binaries in the repository (as opposed to a package manager or building from source), the project emphasizes binaries are third-party and comes with inherent risk.
