# More information: Waterfox

Waterfox is a fork of Firefox primarily maintained by Alex Kontos with contributions from the open source community. Waterfox initially gained traction because it was one of the only browsers available for x64-bit systems.

While stripping Mozilla's telemetry and implementing more privacy-friendly defaults, Waterfox definitively marketed itself as a privacy-first browser; it was primarily built for optimization and speed.

Waterfox entered a partnership with analytics and advertising company, System1 in December 2019. As of July 2023, Waterfox has regained its independent status, dropping the partnership with System1.
