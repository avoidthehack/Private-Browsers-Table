# More information: Vivaldi

Vivaldi is a fork of Chromium and markets itself as the most feature-packed and customizable browser available with user privacy coming first. Vivaldi was initially released in 2015. It's often considered a continuation of the "original" Opera browser as the company developing the browser was a co-founder of Opera Software.

Vivaldi has numerous native features, including a contacts manager, private calendar, mail client, and quick note taker (in addition to an ad blocker).
