# More information: Otter Browser

Otter Browser is an open source browser based on the QT WebEngine. Its primary aim is to recreate the "best aspects of the classic Opera UI."

Otter Browser must be installed by building it from the source code. Though there are official and unofficial packages available, they appear lag behind updates to the source code itself. Binaries are labeled as experimental by the developers (and also are out of date.)
